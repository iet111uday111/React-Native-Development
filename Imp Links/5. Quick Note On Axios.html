<p>Hi!  The next section introduces a library called Axios, which currently has some compatibility issues with React Native.  If you have <em>any</em> issues with Axios, check out this thread: <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-react-native-and-redux-course/learn/v4/questions/1924782" rel="nofollow">https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-react-native-and-redux-course/learn/v4/questions/1924782</a>.  You can use the native 'fetch' library in place of Axios.</p>
